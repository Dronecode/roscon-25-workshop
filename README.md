## About
This full-day workshop is designed for ROS 2 developers ready to dive into aerial robotics with PX4. Youâ€™ll connect ROS 2 nodes to PX4â€™s real-time flight stack, stream telemetry into RViz, build offboard control logic, and integrate perception using Gazebo, ArUco markers, and LiDAR. By the end, youâ€™ll have a complete simulation environment, reusable code, and a path to real hardwareâ€”no prior PX4 knowledge required.

This repository contains all the materials for the ROSCon 2025 PX4 + ROS 2 Workshop.

## Outline

### Introduction & Drone Architecture
### Environment Setup
### Control Pipelines
#### Offboard Demo
Build the workspace
```
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

Launch the PX4 SITL environment with Gazebo and DDS Agent and QGC
```
make px4_sitl gz_x500
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
```

Run the Offboard demo node
```
ros2 run offboard_demo offboard_demo
```
#### Custom Mode Demo
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
TODO: For some reason px4_msgs and px4_ros2_cpp has to be built before the other packages so first:
```
colcon build --packages-select px4_msgs px4_ros2_cpp
```
then 
```
colcon build
```
```
source install/setup.bash
```
Launch the PX4 SITL environment with Gazebo and DDS Agent and QGC
```
make px4_sitl gz_x500
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
```
Run the Custom demo node
```
ros2 run custom_mode_demo custom_mode_demo 
```
Arm the drone in QGC and select the CustomWaypoint mode



### Perception & Application
#### Precision Land
#### Run the simulation environment
Launch PX4 sim
```
make px4_sitl gz_x500_mono_cam_down_aruco
```
Launch micro dds
```
MicroXRCEAgent udp4 -p 8888
```
Launch the ros2 nodes (aruco_tracker)
```
Launch file with the bridges:
```
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch aruco_tracker aruco_tracker.launch.py 
```

View the video (/image_proc is the annoted image)
```
ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view
```

Launch the ros2 nodes (precision_land)
```
source install/setup.bash 
ros2 run precision_land precision_land
```
OR
Launch file with the params:
```
ros2 launch precision_land precision_land.launch.py
```
Once the nodes are running the Precision Land mode is going to show up in QGC
